NICLA VISION + MQTT Hands-on

The MQTT slides clarify some important steps for these tasks

Task 1 : write Arduino code connects to WiFi and then sends data via MQTT. Every second, the terminal will show messages

Task 2 : Read the accelerometer data from the Nicla, send it via MQTT and visualize it using an MQTT client.
         Send data only when a certain threshold is met, send a specific message when a certain threshold is met (alert message).
         
Task 3 : Send both raw data and an alert message in different topics.
