# NICLA VISION with Arduino programming Hands-on


Task 1 "blink_afap": Blink the builtin led as fast as possible
Task 2 "acceleration_detector": Blink the LED faster if a stronger acceleration is detected
Task 3 "acceleration_detector_colors" : Change the color of the LED according to the axis where the acceleration is stronger
Task 4 : Send a message using Serial Monitor when acceleration is stronger than a threshold value. -done already in task 2 and task 3-
Task 5 : Blink the LED faster if the object is closer
Task 6 : Change the color of the LED according to the distance of the object (from Yellow to Red, for example)
Task 7 : Send a message using Serial Monitor when distance is shorter than a threshold value.
Task 8 "Eye-saver" : Using the Time of Flight (ToF) sensor, the Eye Saver will check if a person is too close to the laptop screen. 
                     If so, a red LED will start blinking.
Task 9 "Door-alarm" : Using the gyroscope or the accelerometer sensor, the Door alarm will turn an LED to RED if the door is open.
                     The LED will be OFF if the door is closed.
